3 testbench strategies have been proposed.
vhd_classic
The first one is to use the instruction name (constants) described in the instruction set package
and affect instructions to an instruction signals. Branching can not be done, but such a test case
can be used for regression tests on several processors, to test a common set of instructions.

rom_preliminary
The second one (aborted before the end) is to generate a VHDL file from assembly code. 
This could be done by modifying gpasm for example in ordre to specify a VHDL output standard.
The testbench needs to be compiled again when the code changes and it does not seem a very good
idea.

finally
A function that reads a .hex files at simulation time and sets a std_logic_vector array is the
choosen way to test both the device and the embedded software.
